## üß† Overview

This project is a **formula-based encryption and decryption challenge** designed entirely in Microsoft Excel.  
It demonstrates how complex algorithmic logic can be achieved **purely through native Excel functions** ‚Äî no VBA, no macros, no external scripts.

Two files are included:

- `EXP_LIGH.pdf` ‚Äî a **public ‚Äúdecoder test sheet‚Äù** providing the cipher map, offset key, and masked output.  
- `EXP_LIGH_Challenge.xlsx` ‚Äî an **interactive version** with working formulas intact, allowing users to **test and observe the decoding logic in action.**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The proprietary cipher mechanics and full decryption logic remain protected.  
> Both versions are redacted to preserve the underlying intellectual property.

## üéØ Purpose

This project showcases:
- Advanced formula engineering and logical design within Excel
- Algorithmic reasoning and modular data transformation
- Secure, no-code approaches to encryption and decryption
- Applied metacognitive design ‚Äî using spreadsheet logic to simulate cognitive problem-solving

## üìÅ Files

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **EXP_LIGH.pdf** | Public challenge worksheet containing cipher data, offset key, and masked output for review. |
| **EXP_LIGH_Challenge.xlsx** | Live workbook with testable formulas allowing safe experimentation and theory validation. |

## üß© The Challenge

Within the workbook and PDF, you‚Äôll find a cipher table, an offset key, and a masked output string.  
Your objective is to determine how the system *could* decode the text in **G18**, using the visible data and your own logic theories.

You are encouraged to:
- Test and observe how variable changes impact outputs  
- Explore how offset keys might shift cipher positions  
- Analyze string manipulation through Excel‚Äôs modern function stack  
- Share insights or decoding theories via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/joannbalsamo)

## üß∞ Technical Concepts Demonstrated

- Dynamic logic sequencing via `LET`, `MAP`, `SEQUENCE`, and `TEXTJOIN`  
- Lookup patterning through `XLOOKUP` and `INDEX` arrays  
- Offset-based cipher manipulation using `MOD` and key derivation  
- Data obfuscation and structured automation without code dependencies  
- Integration of process automation principles into spreadsheet design

## üîí Security & IP Notice

This repository is provided for educational and conceptual demonstration only.  
To protect the integrity of the original project:

- The true cipher logic, offset algorithms, and decoding structure are redacted.  
- Shared materials are intended for **testing, observation, and theory development only.**  
- Redistribution or replication of the full cipher logic is not permitted without consent.
